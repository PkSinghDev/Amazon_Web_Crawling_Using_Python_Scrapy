#### Project Overview <br />
Artificial Intelligence is heavily dependent on Data as well as it's on quality. However, there is a significant problem with the lack of data in machine learning. AI requires a certain amount of data for efficient analysis, training, and performance, as if the data sufficiency lacks, it won't be possible to accomplish a reliable project. Amazon Website is a collection of wide variety of data types. It has good quality data be it to images or texts ranging from electronic items to all kinds of fashion products. These can be very helpful in creating small scale Machine Learning/Deep Learning Projects. This project can however be used to extract data from other websites as well.
